##reinforcement-learning-robot-in-maze
------------------------------------------------------------
Reinforcement learning, a Q learning algorithm, implementation on a 
robot that tryies to solve randomly created maze and reach the goal.
Note that you can run .m files both on Matlab and Octave.

1. **reinforcement_learning.m**  
     Initialize necessary variables and matrices.   
     Execute this .m file to display Q and Maze matrices.
2. **create_random_maze.m**    
     Create maze matrix and put random obstacles in the maze.
3. **construct_q_matrix.m**
